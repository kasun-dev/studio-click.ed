            Hi, I&apos;m Kasun Sampath â€” the creator behind Studio Clicked. Photography
            has always been more than a hobby for me; it&apos;s a way to capture the
            beauty, emotion, and stories in everyday life. Every photo I take is a
            reflection of the moment, the feeling, and the people in it.
          </p>

          <p
            className="text-base text-black"
            style={{ fontFamily: "'Roboto', sans-serif" }}
          >
            From casual portraits to events, I focus on creating images that are
            authentic, timeless, and full of life. I believe that every person has a
            unique story, and my goal is to capture it in a way that feels personal
            and meaningful.
          </p>

            Studio Clicked is my space to experiment, learn, and share my vision with
            the world. If you&apos;re looking for photography that is genuine, creative,
            and tailored to you, I&apos;d love to work with you and bring your moments to
            life.
          </p>
